# Introduction
The Digital Game System is a Pong game developed on the DE1-SoC FPGA board using Verilog. The project demonstrates a high level of digital design expertise, incorporating advanced control logic, complex FSMs, and multifunctional memory blocks to create a dynamic and 
engaging gaming experience. The game is Christmas-themed, featuring holiday-inspired graphics and music.

# Requirements
Before running the game, ensure you have the following:

- DE1-SoC FPGA board
- Intel's Quartus Prime software installed on your computer

# Setup
1. Connect the DE1-SoC FPGA board to your computer.
2. Open Quartus Prime and load the project by opening the pong.qpf file.
3. Import the DE1-SoC assignment file (DE1_SoC.qsp) into the project.
4. Compile the project to generate the necessary configuration files.

# Running the Game
1. Navigate to the Programmer section in Quartus Prime.
2. Load the configuration file by selecting the pong.sof file located in the output_files folder.
3. Program the DE1-SoC FPGA board.
4. Once the programming is complete, disconnect and reconnect the FPGA board.

# Gameplay
- Use the paddle controls to hit the Christmas-themed ball and score points.
- Enjoy the festive graphics and music that capture the holiday spirit.
- Feel free to customize the game by exploring the Verilog code and making modifications.

# Acknowledgments
Thank you for trying out the Digital Game System! This project wouldn't be possible without the DE1-SoC FPGA board and Intel's Quartus Prime. Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or share your holiday gaming experience.
